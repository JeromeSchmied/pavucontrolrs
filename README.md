# pavucontrolrs

A TUI (curses) clone of [pavucontrol](https://freedesktop.org/software/pulseaudio/pavucontrol/) written in rust.

## Features

Mostly those provided by pavucontrol, plus a few small extras. Notable omission is live level meters.

## How to Use

Press `?` key to see keybindings, the rest should be pretty self explanatory.

## Disclaimer

This is my first rust project. Open to critique.
